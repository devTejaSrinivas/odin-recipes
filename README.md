# odin-recipes

This repository is one of the first projects I made as a part of  The Odin Project's cirriculum for learning full stack web development. This is a very basic website that provides links to some recipes.

# Things I Learnt from this 

1) I learned to use git version control system . I used the 
   following commands to do so : 
        `git add . ` --> For adding changes to staging area
        `git commit -m "message"` --> For commiting those staged changes
        `git push origin` --> Pushing the changes back to the remote repository 

2) I learned how to publish a repository through GitHub Pages 

3) I have implemented this project using ubuntu running on a virtual system.
